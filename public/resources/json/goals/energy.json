    "text": "In 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which include a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy, SDG 7, calling to \"ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\".\r\n\r\nEnergy lies at the heart of both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Achieving SDG7 will open a new world of opportunities for millions of people through new economic opportunities and jobs, empowered women, children and youth, better education and health, more sustainable, equitable and inclusive communities, and greater protections from, and resilience to, climate change. The Global Roadmap for Accelerated SDG 7 Action resulting from the High-level Dialogue on Energy 2021 provides a guide for collective action on energy across sectors.\r\n\r\nDESA supports these efforts by providing secretariat services for intergovernmental discussions on energy, by conducting and facilitating relevant policy analysis, and by engaging in the required capacity building.",
